00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Without you, it's hard to survive

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

01:00.000 --> 01:43.000
[Drop]

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
You make me rise when I fall


02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

02:36.000 --> 03:04.000
[Drop]

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side

03:18.100 --> 03:34.000
